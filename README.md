Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger system that allows multiple parties to record and verify transactions without the need for intermediaries. In supply chain management, blockchain can be used to increase transparency, traceability, and efficiency of the supply chain process.

This project aims to solve the problems that arise in the Traditional Supply Chain system and solve it with the uprising Blockchain Architecture.
The goal of implementing blockchain technology in supply chain management is to provide fair trade opportunities for end-users while ensuring decentralized dependability and consensus among users. This is achieved by enhancing collaboration between farmers, warehouse management, and retail distributors, and by providing smart contracts that act as insurance entities. Additionally, the relevant information is made available for tracking and tracing timestamps, and quality control and authorization factors are ensured.💻
